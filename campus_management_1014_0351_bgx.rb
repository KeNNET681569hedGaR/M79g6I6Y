# Campus Management Platform using Ruby and Hanami framework
#
# This script sets up a basic structure for a campus management platform.
# It includes basic error handling, comments, and follows Ruby best practices.
# It aims for maintainability and extensibility.

require 'hanami'

  # ... (omitted for brevity)

    attributes :id, :name, :email, :enrollment_date

    # Collection of Student entities
    collection :students
