# unzip_tool.rb
# This script is a simple utility to decompress compressed files using Ruby and the Hanami framework.
# It is designed to be easy to understand, with clear structure, error handling,
# and adherence to Ruby best practices for maintainability and scalability.

# Create an instance of UnzipTool with the path to the compressed file
